Statiq is powerful because it combines a few simple building blocks that can be rearranged and used in limitless combinations. Think of it like LEGOÂ® for static generation.

- Content and data can come from a variety of sources.

- **[Documents](xref:documents-and-metadata)** are created that each contain **[content or data](xref:content-and-data)** and **[metadata](xref:documents-and-metadata#about-metadata)**.

- The documents are processed by **[pipelines](xref:pipelines-and-modules)**.

- Each pipeline consists of one or more **[modules](xref:about-modules)** that manipulate the documents given to it by transforming, aggregating, filtering, or producing entirely new documents.

- The final output of each pipeline is made available to other pipelines and may be written to output files or deployed to hosting services.
