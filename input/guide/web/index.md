Statiq Web is a powerful static web site generation toolkit suitable for most use cases. It's built on top of [Statiq Framework](xref:framework) so you can always extend or customize it beyond those base capabilities as well. This section of the guide describes features exclusive to Statiq Web. This functionality is also available in [Statiq Docs](xref:docs) since that's build on top of Statiq Web.
